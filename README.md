# StreamKeeper-Node-Backend


## Overview

The Movie and TV Show Backend API provides a robust solution for accessing data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It offers endpoints for retrieving, searching, and managing information on movies, TV shows, and people, complete with detailed Swagger documentation. This API serves as an integration layer, offering clean, structured, and well-documented routes for easy access to TMDb's extensive database. 

### Key Features

- **Multi-Server Architecture**: Dedicated servers for movies, TV shows, persons, and general TMDb queries, running on separate ports for modularity.
- **Swagger Integration**: API documentation generated using Swagger for better visualization and interaction.
- **Flexible Search**: Multi-search capabilities for movies, TV shows, and persons with enhanced query handling.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for seamless user experience.
- **Health Check Routes**: To monitor and validate API status and availability.

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building server-side APIs.
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests to TMDb.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
